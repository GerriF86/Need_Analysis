# AGENTS.md â€“ Guide for CodexÂ Agents ðŸª„

> This file explains **where** Codex should work, **how** to set up the environment, **what** quality gates to run, and **how** to submit code changes so they blend in perfectly with the existing project standards.

## 1Â Â Codeâ€‘mapÂ & KeyÂ Folders

| Folder        | Purpose                                              |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `app.py`      | Streamlit entry point (landing pageÂ + wizard)        |
| `pages/`      | Static multipage content (AboutÂ Us, Impressumâ€¦)      |
| `components/` | Reâ€‘usable UI widgets and wizard sections             |
| `logic/`      | Business logic (trigger engine, file parsers)        |
| `services/`   | External services (OpenAIÂ agent, FAISS vectorÂ store) |
| `models/`     | Pydantic dataâ€‘schemas for vacancy profiles           |
| `state/`      | Sessionâ€‘state helpers                                |
| `utils/`      | Global config, prompt templates                      |

ðŸ‘‰ **Stay inside these folders** when adding or editing code.Â Avoid creating new topâ€‘level paths unless absolutely necessary.

## 2Â Â DevÂ EnvironmentÂ (setup.sh)

The CI/CD pipeline expects the following tools:

```bash
# Install static type checker
pip install pyright

# Install project dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# â†’ If the repo switches to Poetry, use:
# poetry install --with test

# Optionally: JavaScript helpers
# pnpm install  # only needed if you touch /assets tooling
```

> **Note:** Setup scripts run in their **own** Bash session.Â Environment variables set here (e.g.Â `export`) will **not** leak to the agent.Â Persist longâ€‘lived secrets in `~/.bashrc` or populate them inside the agent prompt.

### Proxy configuration

All outbound traffic goes through `http://proxy:8080` and must trust the cert at `$CODEX_PROXY_CERT`.Â Tools such as pip, curl, npm already respect these variables.

## 5Â Â How Codex Should Work

| Step                      | Action                                                                                  |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Locate code**           | Use the folder map above; grep by function/class names when unsure.                     |
| **Small tasks**           | Large refactorsÂ â†’ break into several PRs.                                               |
| **Run gates**             | Always execute the *QualityÂ Gates* exactly as scripted.Â Stop if any fail, fix, reâ€‘run.  |
| **Verify output**         | For UI work run `streamlit run app.py` headless (CI does this) and ensure no traceback. |
| **Respect style**         | If `ruff` or `black` fail, call autoâ€‘fix then commit.                                   |
| **Add tests**             | Minimum: cover the new branch/bug path; prefer >90Â % diff coverage.                     |
| **No hardâ€‘coded secrets** | Read via `os.getenv` or Streamlit secrets.                                              |
| **Proxy trust**           | When making network calls in tests, respect `$CODEX_PROXY_CERT`.                        |
